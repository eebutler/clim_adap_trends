All of the code to produce the numerical values reported in the analysis are available in these files.

Two directories contain the code to download and process the crop (crop_data) and weather station (weather_data) used in the analysis.

The model folder contains design_mat.py script which aggregates these data into design matrices for use in the regression results reported. The tr_models.py script conducts the analysis and figs.py produces the figures.

Note that an up to date US census file is needed from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/tiger-line-shapefile-2016-nation-u-s-current-county-and-equivalent-national-shapefile
